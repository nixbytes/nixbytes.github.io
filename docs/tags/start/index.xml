      <description>Hello, in shell echo &amp;quot;Hello World,&amp;quot;. Hello, fellow command line users. First I want to say thank you for visiting this site. This site is for anyone who enjoys working and using the command line aka shell. Soon we are going to add tutorials, talks, news, and man others thing about the command line for any who lives or loves using the command line. Gui is a great interface, but as we know the command line offers more precision and power than any other interface known to humans as this current state.</description>

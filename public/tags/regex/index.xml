          Regex&amp;rsquo;s some hate some love, but in the end, we all need something productive in our life. Some people hate because the mini-language can be arcane. Others love it because it adds superpowers for text processing. Learning the arcane secrets of regex can be a rough experience, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to.
so let do some exercises on regex like emails and IP for your everyday technical needs

          So Linux Academy is offering a great course called Mastering Regular Expressions. After taking a few video course and video, I have to say learning more about regular expressions is more important than ever. Perhaps a few regexes (regular expressions) is fine for simple tasks, but for complex problems, having a deeper knowledge on many levels can boost your technical skill to a new level especially with the need for big data.
